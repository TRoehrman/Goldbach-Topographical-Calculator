# Goldbach Topographical Calculator

An interactive visualization of the Goldbach Topographical Calculator plus links to null‑test code and data. This is not a proof; it’s a way to make the structure visible and testable.

## Quickstart
- Open the visual calculator in your browser:
  - calculator/GoldbachCalculator.html
- Code + data from the video:
  - YouTube Ep1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cLTkTKSSI0
  - Null‑test artifacts (10.1 GB, Google Drive):
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BSsH8OgPti4aLu47YO4whu6RM_6XAOme
 To download full null‑test artifacts:
  - python scripts/download_artifacts.py


## What this repo contains
- calculator/GoldbachCalculator.html – main interactive HTML/JS calculator
- (Planned) separate replication/metrics repo with non‑visual null tests and prereg plan

## Status
- v1: visual calculator and initial data links
- Next: minimal null‑tests runner + Colab badge for a ~10‑minute replication path
